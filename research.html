    <h2>Deep learning for high-frequency camera pose estimation</h2>
    <p>
      In autonomous drone racing, a drone flies through a gate track at high speed. Some solutions involve the use of camera localisation to control the drone. However, effective localisation is very demanding in processing time, which may compromise the flight speed. To address the latter, we propose a deep learning-based method for camera localisation that processes a small sequence of images of the scene at high-frequency operation. Our solution is a compact convolutional neural network based on the Inception network that uses a sequence of grey-scale images rather than colour images as input; we have called this network ‘GreySeqNet’. Our approach aims at leveraging the localisation process by using a small stack of consecutive images fed as input to the network. To save computational effort, we explorethe use of grey images instead of colour images, thus saving convolutional layers. We have conducted experiments in a simulated environment to measure the performance of GreySeqNet in different race tracks with variations in gate’s height and position. According to the results obtained in several test runs, our method achieves a camera pose estimation at an average operation frequency of 83 Hz running on GPU and 26 Hz on CPU, with an average camera pose error of 31 cm.

    <p>In this work, we present a methodology for autonomous navigation in the context of Autonomous Drone Racing. Using visual information it has a blind spot when the camera is near to the object.  We propose based on CNN gate detect a stochastic algorithm for distance estimation that overcomes the blind spot during autonomous navigation.

    <p>In this video, We show our proposed algorithm designed to autonomous Drone flight in the context of Autonomous Drone Racing. Our proposed algorithm is based on CNN to predict the drone's pose. Our algorithm takes the pose and commands the drone to centre to the gate and then cross it. The first part of the video shows the results testing drone's pose prediction vs groundtruth. The second part demonstrated an autonomous flight to cross three gates in a real environment race track. Our proposed CNN can estimates the drones pose at high speed up to 100 Hz.</p>

    <p>To fly through a gate in the ADR context, it would be important to know the position of the drone related to the gate in order to design a flight trajectory that can cross the gate. In this video, we show our proposed algorithm based on CNN to predict the Drone's pose and based on this pose our algorithm commands the Drone to cross the gate. At begin, it is shown the prediction vs the ground truth in 2D and 3D view, finally, we present our algorithm in action, it crosses three gates autonomously in a simulated environment.</p>
